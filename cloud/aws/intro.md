# AWS

> Before Cloud, companies host On-Premises  
	1. self host  
	2. Collocation ( Take our server to data center)  
	3. Lease servers   

> Virtualization originated in 2006. This allowed a single physical server into multiple dedicated servers.  
> Amazon leveraged this idea( EC2 and S3 started in 2006).

### Region
	Aws has regions all over the world. region contain of clusters. Choose region based on location or service required.
	Choosing a region depends on the many factors, Compliance,Proxity, Available Services and Pricing

### Availability Zones ( AZ)
	Each region has 2-6 zones, connected through high speed/low latency networks. ( Avoid disasters)
	AZ contains one or more data centres.
	Clone your service intlo atleast 2 AZ's


### POP

	close to users than regions or AZ
	used for caching

	Regional POP vs Edge POP
		Regional POP - far and further away, but more cache storage
		Edge POP     - near to users, but lesser cache

> Global Services like Iam are same for all regions, whereas other services like EC2 change based on the region.  
> Shared responsible model ( for security, both aws and user are responsible)  
> AWS accessing can be done in three ways, AWS console, CLI and SDK.
